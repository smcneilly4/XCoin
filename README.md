## What is xCoin?
---

xCoin is a next-generation blockchain protocol that enables any user to begin earning, sending, and spending cryptocurrency easily, without the need for advanced technical knowledge. xCoin uses a state-of-the-art Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that offers opportunities for users to stake their coins or allocate their coins to Masternodes, which secure the network and verify transactions.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable version of the HaloCoin Project software, visit our website's [download page](https://diviproject.org/downloads), or read our [whitepaper](https://wiki.diviproject.org/#whitepaper).

## License 
---

xCoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT for more information.

## Developing
---

The `master0` branch is regularly built and tested by Divi's core development team, and is typically the most stable version of the software, but this cannot be guaranteed at any given time.

## Building
---

To build from source on UNIX systems, follow these instructions.

### System requirements

C++ compilers are memory-hungry. It is recommended to have at least 1 GB of
memory available when compiling DIVI Core. With 512MB of memory or less
compilation will take much longer due to swap thrashing.

### Dependencies

These dependencies are required:

 Library     | Purpose          | Description
 ------------|------------------|----------------------
 libssl      | SSL Support      | Secure communications
 libboost    | Boost            | C++ Library

Optional dependencies:

 Library     | Purpose          | Description
 ------------|------------------|----------------------
 miniupnpc   | UPnP Support     | Firewall-jumping support
 libdb4.8    | Berkeley DB      | Wallet storage (only needed when wallet enabled)
 qt          | GUI              | GUI toolkit (only needed when GUI enabled)
 protobuf    | Payments in GUI  | Data interchange format used for payment protocol (only needed when GUI enabled)
 libqrencode | QR codes in GUI  | Optional for generating QR codes (only needed when GUI enabled)
